## API

```js
getGitHubContributionsHistory((username: String), (confg: Object)).then((res) =>
  console.log(res)
)
```

The API takes two params. The fist is the users `username` as a `string`. The second is a config object. The config object has 3 elements.

```js
config = {
  total: 'total',
  byYear: 'byYear',
  proxy: 'https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/'
}
```

1. total \
   pass `total: 'total'` to get the total contributions for a user
2. byYear \
   pass `byYear: 'byYear'` to get the total contributions for a user sorted by year
3. proxy \
   the proxy arg would likely be required if you are using this node package in the browser because of [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS). `proxy` can have 3 possible configurations. If you do not include `proxy` in the config object passed to the function then no proxy will be used. If you pass `proxy: true` in the config object, then the proxy [https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/](https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/) will be used. As a third option, you can also pass your your own proxy as a string such as `proxy: 'https://your-cors-bypass-url.com/'`.

### Error Handling

1. 429: The API should return `429` if there are too many requests
2. 200: `200` Okay
3. 400: `400 Bad request`
4. `{error: javascript error}`
5. No more than 50 redirects allowed

### If you are getting CORS errors such as

![cors-error](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*bI2yxKryqJzyUkud) \
You probably need to pass a proxy. This can be done by setting `proxy: true` in the config object passed a s second argument to `getGitHubContributionsHistory`

### Issues

Given that this API is scraping Github webpages for the desired data, it is a) not the fastest; and b) dependent on the DOM nodes for Github user profiles not changing to a large extent. If it stops working, open an issue on Github and i'll fit it asap! :)
